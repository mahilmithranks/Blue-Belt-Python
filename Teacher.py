# A teacher is preparing a test with true/false questions.
# The correct answers to these questions are given in a string
# answerKey, where each character is either (true) or
# (false),
# To confuse students, the teacher wants to maximize the
# number of consecutive questions with the same answer (either
# all or in a row).
# You are allowed to change up to answers in the
# string. For example, you can change
# to or to Your goal is to determine
# the maximum number of consecutive identical answers
# or that can be achieved after
# performing at most changes.
# Input Format
# I. The first line contains a string answerKey of length
# 2. The second line contains an integer representing
# the maximum number of changes allowed.
# Output Format
# â€¢ Print a single integer, the maximum number of
# consecutive or that can be achieved
# after performing at most changes.
